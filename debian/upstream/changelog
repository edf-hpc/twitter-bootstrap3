    #13003: Move padding on .radios and .checkboxs to their immediate <label>s to avoid the no-click deadzone caused by negative margin.

Modals

Browser bugs

We've started tracking unresolved browser bugs that currently impact Bootstrap's development in some way. We call it the Wall of browser bugs. We've also documented a few new bugs with this release:

    #10690: Reported a bug in Firefox for responsive images (those with max-width: 100%) in table cells. No other browsers are affected. See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=975632. Until a fix is shipped, add width: 100%; to your responsive images in table cells.
    #12548: Reported a bug in Chrome where date inputs stop resizing when appearing with display: table-cell;. See https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=346051.
    #12476: Document IE8's limitation of borders on buttons in a justified button group. Currently the only way to get borders on those buttons is to wrap each button in an additional .btn-group, just like the button groups using <button> elements.

v3.1.0 - Jan 30, 2014

New features

    Three new templates: Blog, Cover, and Dashboard.
    #10884: Add .info variant to contextual table classes.
    #11138: Add contextual styles to list groups.
    #11162: Add new sizes, .modal-lg and .modal-sm, to modals for quicker settings on modals. Only applies to modals above the small breakpoint.

    #11572: Add contextual background-color classes to match our existing text classes. (This also moves both sets of classes to the Helper Classes section of the CSS docs.)
    #11675: Add .text-justify class to round out the text alignment classes.
    #11836: Add new form control feedback classes to toggle icons for each validation state. Works on regular forms, horizontal, and inline.

While we originally wanted v3.1 to include RTL support, we decided to hold back on that for some potentially beneficial unreleased tooling. We'll share more on that when we know more, but suffice to say it's been bumped to v3.2.
CSS changes

    #10951: Add outline: 0 to .modal to prevent a focus outline from appearing in Chrome for Windows.
    #11107: Add @modal-backdrop-opacity variable for customizable modal backdrop.
    #11266: Apply a pixel-based line-height that matches the height to date inputs for iOS 7 for proper vertical alignment of text in the form control.

    #11676: Add -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch; to modals for smooth scrolling on iOS devices.

    #11748: Updated .scale() mixin so that it accepts optional vertical scale as second parameter.
    #11750: Reverts v3.0.3's refactor to contextual table classes to ensure they work with striped tables.

    #11786: Nest media queries within print utilities for mixin-friendliness.

    #11829: Add .make-xs-column mixins to complement the recently added extra small predefined grid classes.
    #11836: Along with the form validation update, we reset some key form and icon styles:
        All .form-controls within inline forms are set to width: auto; to prevent stacking of .form-label within a .form-group.
        Removes all select.form-control settings since those are now inherited by the above change
        Removes the width: 1em; from the Glyphicons because it was virtually impossible to override.
    #11841: Breadcrumb padding values now use variables.
    #11859: Restore @dropdown-caret-color variable, but deprecate it.
    #11861: Add @list-group-active-text-color variable for improved customization on active list group items.

    #12249: Add and use @modal-md Less variable for uniformity.

    #12286: Only remove appropriate border-radius from first and last tables or list groups in panels.
    #12353: Scope table border reset in panels to first-child rows.
    #12359: Reset min-width on <fieldset>s so they don't break responsive tables and behave more like standard block level elements.
    #12406: Upgrade to Normalize v3.
    #12422: Reset height on select[multiple] in .input-size() mixin.
    #12424: Given Normalize v3 upgrade, account for change on <figure> element so that we don't cause backward compatibility issues.

Remote modal content

If you currently use the modal's remote option, be aware this release may break your modals. Yes, this is a breaking change, but it's first and foremost a bug fix one that corrects a rather longstanding and overlooked error. Our apologies for any headaches it may cause, but it's been missed in the last few patch releases.

See the #11933 pull request for details on the code changes.
Deprecations

    #10370: Deprecated the .pull-right method for aligning dropdown menus. Includes the following changes:
        Removed an old and unused pair of selectors that didn’t properly target the right-aligned navbar alignment of dropdown menus.
        Deprecates the .pull-right alignment in favor of a more specific and unique class name.
        Adds .dropdown-menu-right as the new alignment class. This is then mixin-ed into the .navbar-right.navbar-nav dropdown menus for auto-alignment (keeping the current behavior we have today).
        Adds new ability to override that auto-alignment though with the new .dropdown-menu-left, which is mixin-ed in the same way to provide the appropriate specificity of an override. This should never need to be used except for within right-aligned .navbar-nav components.
    #11660: Deprecate small and .small in blockquote citation in favor of footer element.
    #12398: Deprecate .box-shadow() mixin.

Documentation

    #10486: Add note about data-toggle dropdown dependency.
    #10505: Document more of our LESS variables and mixins (not all, but the commonly used ones).

    #11780: Don't ignore Gruntfile.js or package.json in bower.json as they're required for compilation.
    #11790: Switch from Recess to LESS compiler.
        Dropped grunt-recess for grunt-contrib-less to get the latest version of LESS (v1.5.x) since Recess was still quite behind.
        Adds CSScomb to take place of Recess's CSS linting. Includes custom .csscomb.json in project root with basically the same property order as Recess.
        Fixes duplicate CSS generation from the nested .clearfix class and mixin by switching to &:extend(.mixin all) (also mentioned in changes section).

    291a23a: Audited Customizer variables section and rearranged content

Deprecated

    #9963, #10567: Deprecate @screen-* classes for @screen-*-min to better match the @screen-*-max variables and provide more context to their actual uses.
    #10005: Finish removing uses of @screen-{device} variables by deprecating them for @screen-*-min wherever possible.
    #10100: Deprecate .hide-text mixin for .text-hide. This matches our class-mixin strategy elsewhere (e.g., .clearfix) and ensures the class and mixin use the same name to avoid confusion.
    #10125: Deprecate inconsistent container variables for new @container-{screen-size} variables (e.g., use @container-sm instead of @container-tablet)
    #10769: Deprecate .hide for .hidden so we don't duplicate functionality.


v3.0.0 - Aug 19, 2013

For those who haven't been following along too closely, here's a recap of all the biggest changes shipping with Bootstrap 3:

    New design and an optional theme! With v3, we've gone flat. Don't call it a trend—it's all about customization, folks. Since we simplified the aesthetics though, we thought it'd help to have an optional theme. To use it, check out the Bootstrap theme example.
    Mobile first and always responsive! Nearly everything has been redesigned and rebuilt to start from your handheld devices and scale up.
    Brand new Customizer! It's been redesigned, is now compiled in the browser instead of Heroku, has better dependency support, and even has built-in error handling. Better yet, we now save your customizations to an anonymous Gist for easy reuse, sharing, and modifications.
    Better box model by default. Everything in Bootstrap gets box-sizing: border-box, making for easier sizing options and an enhanced grid system.
    Super-powered grid system. With four tiers of grid classes—phones, tablets, desktops, and large desktops—you can do some super crazy awesome layouts.
    Rewritten JavaScript plugins. All events are now namespaced, no-conflict stuff works way better, and more.
    New Glyphicons icon font! While they were gone for a while, we've since restored the Glyphicons to the main repo. In 2.x, they were images, but now they're in font format and include 40 new glyphs.
    Overhauled navbar. It's now always responsive and comes with some super handy and re-arrangable subcomponents.
    Modals are way more responsive. We've overhauled the modal code to make it way more responsive on mobile devices. They now scroll the entire viewport instead of having a max-height.
    Added some components! New to the mix are panels and list groups.
    Removed some components! We've dropped the accordion (replaced with collapsible panels), submenus, typeahead, and a few more small items. (Worth celebrating as much as adding new ones.)
    More consistent base and sizing classes. Buttons, tables, forms, alerts, and more have been updated to have more consistent classes for easier customizer and extensibility.
    Docs have been blown up, yo. We've added a lot of new documentation, not only for our components, but for browser support (including gotchas and bugs), license FAQs, third party support (and workarounds), accessibility, and more.
    Dropped Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox 3.6 support. For Internet Explorer 8, you'll need to include Respond.js for all the media queries to work correctly. You can read more about browser support in the docs.

For our pre-release testers and others who have been following along with the RCs, here's a list of some of the more prominent changes made since RC2:

    Hella bugs have been fixed (duh, right?).
    Restored the Glyphicons icon font.
    Navbars now require a .navbar-default for the standard version.
    Panels now require a .panel-default for the standard gray variation.
    Alerts now require a modifier class (e.g., .alert.alert-warning for the previously default yellow alert).
    Multiple responsive utilities can now be applied to the same element.
    Examples are back in the main repo and have been fully updated.
    Docs have been updated for more consistent placement, naming, etc.
    Customizer compiling bugs have all been fixed.
    The optional theme has been added and is demonstrated in an example.
    Jumbotrons are now made to extend the full width of the viewport with a container inside, but if you reverse that, the jumbotron in a container will be rounded and padded.
    The navbar components have been updated to better account for the presence of containers and more. You'll see some new margin and padding changes, but no markup changes should be required.


v3.0.0 RC2 - Aug 13, 2013

Second release candidate for the upcoming Bootstrap 3. For a complete set of changes between RC1 and RC1, see the commit logs. Key changes are summarized below. To check it out, visit http://getbootstrap.com or use one of the download options below.

There's no dedicated ZIP file for the compiled CSS and JS—that falls out of date too quickly.

To stay up to date, download the latest 3.0.0-wip instead of the download options below.
Key changes

    Docs changes:
        The Customizer is back! Still needs some work, but functionality has been rewritten and will be improved as we head to final release.
        Added new mention to our browser compatibility docs to highlight the workaround for Internet Explorer 10 in Windows Phone 8 not picking up media queries. See #9171.
        Added new section to the Getting Started page for documenting third party and addon compatibility issues. See #9175.
        Added new Accessibility section, lots of new aria and role attributes, and more for improved 508 and WCAG compliancy. See #9186. Also improved used of more semantic HTML5 elements in docs per #9332, #9347, and #9352.
        Added HTML validation tests, and made any existing failures pass. See #9396.

    Global CSS changes:
        Update vertical and horizontal gradients to make start and end color parameters come first, then start and end positions. Fixes #9049.
        Make .pull-right and .pull-left classes use !important to avoid needing overrides due to specificity (like in navbar, button groups, etc). See #8697.
        Lots of variable additions to components.
        Updated gradients to not include background-color for improved use of rgba() colors within mixins. See #8877

    Grid system:
        Overhauled grid system to include four tiers instead of the original three of RC1. We now have .col-xs (phones), .col-sm (tablets), .col-md (desktops), and .col-lg (large desktops). Responsive utilities have been updated to match these new tiers as well. See relevant commit.
        .rows only have negative left and right margins if they sit within a .container. This resolves the horizontal scrollbar issue for folks with full page containers (restoring the full behavior of the old fluid container from 2.x). See #8959.
        Grid now includes offset, push, and pull classes for each break point See #8974.
        Updated mixins to include ability to specify gutter width as a second parameter. See #8935.

    Buttons:
        Buttons and inputs, and their large counterparts, are now a bit shorter.
        New default button styles and higher contrast on :hover and :active states. Fixes #8786.
        New classes for size modifier classes—instead of .btn-mini, .btn-small, or .btn-large, we now have .btn-xs, .btn-sm, and .btn-lg. See #9056.
        New button group sizing classes: just add .btn-group-xs, .btn-group-sm, or .btn-group-lg to any .btn-group and you're good to go. See #9295.

    Forms:
        Similar to the new button classes, we have new input size classes: .input-sm and .input-lg. See #9056.
        Input focus states now generated via variable and mixin. Use the @input-focus-border variable and .form-control-focus mixin to generate a custom border-color and box-shadow. See commit . * Size modifier classes for large and small components—including buttons, form inputs, pagination, and wells—have all been standardized to use -sm or -lg. See #9056.
        Inline forms now require the use of .form-group, per #9382, to properly align and size all (native and custom) form controls. This also helps make form markup more consistent and flexible (just swap a class), so woohoo!
        Added .static-form-control to account for static, placeholder text in horizontal form layouts. Fixes #8150.
        New input group sizing classes: just add .input-group-sm or .input-group-lg to any .input-group and you're good to go. See #9295.

    Dropped accordion for updated panel.
        We've removed the accordion and instead chosen to extend the panel component to provide the same functionality. See #9404.

    Navbar:
        Overhauled navbar to always be responsive and mobile first.
            Navbars now require a .navbar-header to wrap up brand and toggle.
            .nav-collapse has been renamed to .navbar-collapse and automatically hits a max-height and will overflow to keep your nav content in the same viewport.
            See details in #9403.
        Navbar's no longer use .pull-left or .pull-right, but rather .navbar-left and .navbar-right. This avoids issues with specificity due to chaining classes and enables easier styling.

    Miscellaneous component changes:
        Alerts that are to be dismissed now require .alert-dismissable to properly pad the alert and align the close button. See #9310.
        Responsive utilities are now mixin-able thanks to #9211.
        Dropped .alert-block for a simpler .alert.
        Linked panel titles now inherit their color. Fixes #9061.
        List groups in panels no longer require .list-group-flush.
        Labels now require .label-default for the "default" gray option. See #9123.
        Labels now collapse automatically (not in IE8) when empty. See #9241.

Minor release to add carousel indicators, improve tooltips, improve dev setup, and fix hella bugs.

    Repository changes:
        Local instead of global dependencies for our makefile and install process. Now getting started is way easier—just run npm install.

        Moved changelog to be within the repo instead of as a wiki page.
    New and improved features:
        Added carousel indicators! Add the HTML and it automagically works.

        Added print utility classes to show and hide content between screen and print via CSS.
        Updated input groups to make them behave more like default form controls. Added display: inline-block;, increased margin-bottom, and added vertical-align: middle; to match <input> styles.
        Added .horizontal-three-colors() gradient mixin (with example in the CSS tests file).
        Added .text-left, .text-center, and .text-right utility classes for easy typographic alignment.

    Popovers:
        No longer inherits font-size: 0; when placed in button groups.
        Arrows refactored to work in IE8, and use less code.
        Plugin no longer inserts popover content into a <p>, but rather directly into .popover-content.
    Labels and badges: Now automatically collapse if they have no content.
    Tables: Nesting support with .table-bordered and .table-striped greatly improved.
    Typeahead:
        Now inserts dropdown menu after the input instead of at the close of the document.
        Hitting escape will place focus back on the <input>.
    Print styles, from HTML5 Boilerplate, have been added.


v2.2.1 - Oct 31, 2012

Hotfix release to address the carousel bug reports.


v2.2.0 - Oct 30, 2012

2.1.2 is now 2.2.0: four new example templates, added media component, new typographic scale, fixed that box-shadow mixin bug, fixed z-index issues, and more.

Highlights

    Added four new example templates to the docs, including a narrow marketing page, sign in form, sticky footer, and a fancy carousel (created for an upcoming .net magazine article).
    Added the media component, to create larger common components like comments, Tweets, etc.
    New variable-driven typographic scale based on @baseFontSize and @baseLineHeight.
    Revamped mini, small, and large padding via new variables for inputs and buttons so everything is the same size.
    Reverted 2.1.1's .box-shadow(); mixin change that caused compiler errors.
    Improved dropdown submenus to support dropups and left-aligned submenus.
    Fixed z-index issues with tooltips and popovers in modals.
    Hero unit now sets basic type styles for the entire component, rather than on .hero-unit p { ... }.
    Updated JavaScript plugins and docs to jQuery 1.8.1.
    Added Contributing.md file.
    Added support for installing Bootstrap via Bower.
    Miscellaneous variable improvements across the board.
    Miscellaneous documentation typos fixed.


v2.1.1 - Sep 5, 2012

    New feature: alert text. We documented these new classes, like .text-success, at the bottom of the Typography section along with the long undocumented .muted.
    Fixed a lot of typos in the docs. Spelling is hard.
    Made the .box-shadow() mixin more durable. It no longer requires escaping for multiple shadows, meaning you can easily use variables and functions in them once again.
    Widened .dl-horizontal dt and .horizontal-form .control-group to better handle the increased font-size.
    Dropdown submenus improved: now you only see the next level, not all levels, on hover of the submenu toggle.
    Clarified jQuery and Bootstrap template requirements in Getting Started section.
    select now utilizes @inputBorder.
    .lead now scales up from @baseFontSize instead of being a fixed font-size and line-height.
    Fixed the vertical three color gradient in latest Firefox.
    Reordered some variables that caused errors in certain Less compilers.


v2.1.0 - Aug 20, 2012

    Submenu support on dropdowns
    Affix JavaScript plugin
    Block level buttons
    State classes on table rows
    Improved disabled states on navs and dropdowns

    Improved prepended and appended inputs
    New base font-size and line-height
    Added variable for navbar collapse trigger point
    Fluid grid offsets
    Fluid grid system variables are no longer fixed percentages
    Removed LESS docs page


v2.0.4 - Jun 1, 2012

Docs

    Added type="button" to all dismiss buttons in alerts and modals to avoid a bug in which they prevent their parent's form from properly submitting.
    Added simple documentation to Base CSS for .lead.
    Added new CSS test to illustrate how the navbar, static and fixed, behaves.
    Clarified grid sizing copy to include mention of responsive variations.
    Reformatted the LESS docs page to prevent terrible table displays at smaller grid sizes.
    Miscellaneous typos and tweaks.

CSS

    Refactored forms.less to make our selectors more specific for fewer overrides and less code. Instead of a generic input selector and various resets, we target each type of input like input[type="text"], input[type="password"], etc.
    Form field state (e.g., success or error) now applies to checkbox and radio labels.
    Removed redundant CSS on <p> for font-family, font-size, and line-height.
    Removed redundant color declaration from the <label> element.
    Added variables for dropdown dividers border colors.
    legend and .form-actions share the same border-color, #e5e5e5.
    Fixed some responsive issues with input-prepend and -append, notably with the fluid grid.
    Added special CSS to prevent max-width: 100%; on images from messing up Google Maps rendering.
    Scope opened dropdowns to only immediate children to avoid unintended cascade.
    Similarly, scope floated-right dropdowns to immediate children with .pull-right > .dropdown-menu.
    Updated .placeholder() mixin to use & operator in Less for proper output when compiling.
    Added -ms-input-placeholder to .placeholder() mixin.
    Added CSS3 hyphens mixin.
    Fixed a bug in IE7/8 where certain form controls would not show text if the parent had a filter opacity set.


v2.0.3 - Apr 25, 2012
HTML and CSS

    Overhauled the responsive utility classes to simplify required CSS, add !important to all declarations, and use display: inherit in place of display: block to account for different types of elements.
    Removed > from fluid grid column selectors, meaning every element with a .span* class within a .row-fluid will use percentage widths instead of fixed-pixels.
    Fixed regression in responsive images support as of 2.0.1. We've re-added max-width: 100%; to images by default. We removed it in our last release since we had folks complaining about Google Maps integration and other projects, but we're taking a different stance now on these things and will require developers to make these tweaks on their end.
    Added variable @navbarBrandColor for the brand element in navbars, which defaults to @navbarLinkColor.
    Font-family mixins now use variables for their stacks.
    Fixed an unescaped filter on the .reset-filter() mixin that was causing some errors depending on your compiler.
    Fixed regression in .form-actions background, which was too dark, by adding a new variable @formActionsBackground and changing the color to #f5f5f5 instead of #eee.
    Fixed an issue on button group dropdowns where the background color was not using the button's darker color when the dropdown is open.
    Generalized and simplified the open dropdown classes while adding smarter defaults. Instead of .dropdown.open, we now use just .open. On the defaults side, all dropdown menus now have rounded corners to start.
    Improved active .dropdown-toggle styles (for dropdown buttons) by darkening the background and sharpening the inset shadow to match the active state of buttons.
    Direction of animation on progress bars reversed.
    Fixed input-prepend/append issue with uneditable inputs: .uneditable-input was being floated and a missing comma meant its border-radius for the append option wasn't being applied properly.
    Removed height: auto; from img since it was overriding dimensions set via HTML attributes.
    Fixed an issue of double borders on the top of tables with captions or colgroups.
    Fixed issue with anchor buttons in the .navbar-text. Instead of a general styling on all anchors within an element with that class, we now have a new class to specifically apply appropriate link color.
    Added support for @navbarHeight on the brand/project name and nav links for complete navbar height customization.
    Fixed the black borders on buttons problem in IE7 by removing the border, increasing the line-height, and providing darker background colors.
    Removed excess padding on .search-query inputs in IE7 since it doesn't have border-radius.
    Updated alert messages in Components to use button elements as close icons instead of a. Both can be used, but an a will require href="#" for dismissal on iOS devices.
    Fixed an issue with prepended/appended inputs in Firefox where select elements required two clicks to toggle the dropdown. Resolved by moving the position: relative to the select by default instead of on :focus.
    Added a new mixin, .backface-visibility, to help refine CSS 3D tranforms. Examples and explanation of usage can be found on CSS Tricks.
    Changed specificity of grid classes in responsive layouts under 767px to accurately target input, select, and textarea elements that use .span* classes.
    Horizontal description lists, .dl-horizontal, now truncate terms that are too long to fit in their fixed-width column. In the < 767px responsive layout, they change to their default stacked layout.
    Changed tabbable tabs to prevent issues in left and right aligned tabs. .tab-content would not growing to its parent's full width due to display: table. We removed that and the width: 100% and instead just set overflow: auto to clear the left and right aligned tabs.
    Updated thumbnails to support fluid grid column sizing.
    Added > to most of the button group selectors
    Added new variable, @inputBorderRadius, to all form controls that previously made use of the static 3px value everywhere.
    Changed the way we do border-radius for tables. Instead of the regular mixin that zeros out all other corners, we specify one corner only so they can be combined for use on single column table headers.
    Updated Glyphicons Halflings from 1.5 to 1.6, introducing 20 new icons.
    Added an offset paramater to the .makeColumn.
    Increased the specificity of all tabbable nav selectors to include .nav-collapse to appropriately scope the responsive navbar behavior.
    Fixed uneditable inputs: text now cuts off and does not wrap, making it behave just like a default input.
    Labels and badges are now vertical-align: baseline; so they line up with surrounding text.

Javascript

    Add jshint support
    Add travis-ci support w/ headless phantom integration
    Replace UA sniffing in bootstrap-transitions.js
    Add MSTransitionEnd event to transition plugin
    Fix pause method in carousel (shouldn't restart when hovering over controls)
    Fix crazy opera bug #1776
    Don't open dropdown if target element is disabled
    Always select last item in scrollspy if you've reached the bottom of the document or element
    Typeahead should escape regexp special chars
    If interval is false on carousel, do not auto-cycle
    Add preventDefault support for all initial event types (show, close, hide, etc.)
    Fix collapse bug in ie7+ for initial collapse in
    Fix nested collapse bug
    If transitioning collapse, don't start new transition
    Try to autodetect when to use html/text method in tooltip/popovers to help prevent xss
    Add bootstrap + bootstrap.min.js to gh-pages for @remy and jsbin support

Documentation and repo

    Combined badges and labels into a single LESS file, labels-badges.less, to reduce repeated CSS.
    Separated responsive features into multiple files. We now have a file for each grouping of media queries (tablets and down, tablets to desktops, and large desktops). Additionally, the visible/hidden utility classes and the responsive navbar are in their own files. The output is the same in the compiled CSS, but this should give folks a bit more flexibility.
    Added a new CSS Tests page in the docs (not in the top nav) for better testing of edge cases and extending the use of standard components.
    Removed the bootstrap.zip file from the repo and the make process for faster building and a lighter repo. From now on, the zip will only be in the documentation branch.
    Fixed incorrect use of class instead of ID for tabs example and added documentation for multiple ways of toggling tabs.
    Fixed required markup listed for the specialized navbar search field.
    Removed all mention of @siteWidth, a variable no longer in use.
    Removed mentions of unused @buttonPrimaryBackground variable, which is no longer in use.
    Updated LESS docs page to include all the new variables we added in previous releases.
    Removed broken "dropup" menus from tabs and pills examples (shouldn't have been there in the first place).
    Replaced .badge-error with .badge-important. The error option is not a valid class and was a typo in the docs.
    Fixed mention of how to add plain text to the navbar. Previously the docs stated you only needed a p tag, but the required HTML is any element with class .navbar-text.
    Clarified the use of .tabbable for tabs. The wrapping class is only required for left and right tabs to clear their floats. Also added mention of .fade to fade in tabs.
    Updated forms documentation:
        Remove unnecessary duplicate help text in first example
        Added mention of required input class, .search-query, for the search form variation
        Removed incorrect mention of form fields being display: block; to start as fields are inline-block to start.
    Added mention of data-target attribute for the dropdowns javascript plugin to show how to keep custom URLs intact on links with .dropdown-toggle class.
    Updated the Kippt screenshot on the homepage to reflect their recent responsive redesign and upgrade to 2.0.2.


v2.0.2 - Mar 12, 2012

Documentation updates

    All docs pages now have distinct titles, such as Scaffolding · Twitter Bootstrap.
    Updated the Apple touch icons (now black on black instead of the blue grid) and fixed the links to them in the docs.
    Added new global styles docs section to the Scaffolding page.
        Required use of HTML5 doctype
        Overview of global typographic and links details
        Mention of our embedded CSS reset via Normalize.css
    Added version number to the download button on the docs homepage.
    Updated progress bars section to simplify how the classes stack and more clearly indicate the available optional classes and styles.
    Added a new example, SoundReady.fm, to the homepage
    Added various sizes to the docs for button groups

Resolved bugs

    Removed all IE7 hacks and floats from .input-prepend and .input-append, however, this requires you to ensure there is no whitespace in your code between .add-on and the input.
    In .input-prepend and .input-append, added ability to use add-ons on both sides when you chain the selectors.
    Updated lingering .btn-dark reference to .btn-inverse.
    Fixed issue with content being cut off in .tab-content for tabbable sections.
    Updated .navbar .container to use width: auto; to start and then reset the fixed widths via the #gridSystem mixin (it's a little dirty, but required to avoid adding another class).
    Modal footer buttons are now aligned by their parent via text-align: right; instead of float: right on the button level. This was changed to allow the use of .pull-left and .pull-right to align buttons easily. Double check your button order with this change!
    Fixed problem where default striped progress bar was green instead of blue.
    Fixed CSS selector used for input and textarea grid sizes to properly apply the CSS (was input > .span* and now is input.span*).

New features

    Horizontal dividers support added to nav lists
    Added basic version of badges
    Added visible/hidden classes for devices
    Added support for buttons in input-prepend/append component
    Added .navbar-fixed-bottom support
    Added .dropup support for dropdown menus to pop them upward instead of downward (this is automatically done for the newly added fixed bottom navbar).
    Added mixin for new image replacement technique
    Added pause on hover for the carousel
    Added tons of new variables for typography, buttons, forms, dropdowns, navbar, and more for the LESS pros out there. These variables have also been reflected on the Customize page.
    Added new horizontal description list variation
    Added .disabled class support to the pager component (also added a mention of this to the docs)
    Added .well-large and .well-small classes for extending the well component


v2.0.1 - Feb 17, 2012

    Previously the docs called for use of .control-label in the examples, but the CSS didn't make clear use of it. This class is required for horizontal forms and has been reflected in the CSS.
    We've tried our best to improve rendering of buttons and icons across all browsers. Some issues remain; Firefox throws an !importanton line-height for inputs, so that's the big one.
    We refined the label component style to move away from uppercase.
    Added the black button option, .btn-inverse.
    Added a mini button class, .btn-mini.
    We had to re-add the protocol, http: to the HTML5 schim because IE7-8 wouldn't recognize it, dropping some HTML5 support for those browsers and introducing major performance issues.
    Resolved some issues with responsive layouts where media queries would overlap at 768px and 980px.
    Rearranged Scaffolding docs page to split fixed and fluid grid systems.
    Tons of docs updates for typos and language changes.


v2.0.0 - Feb 1, 2012

Essentially an entire rewrite of the library—docs, CSS, and JavaScript. Adds optional responsive CSS for nearly all components.
Project changes

    Docs: major updates across the board to general structure, examples, and code snippets. Also made responsive with new media queries.
    Docs: all docs pages are now powered by Mustache templates and strings are wrapped in i18n tags for translation by the Twitter Translation Center. All changes to documentation must be done here and then compiled (similar to our CSS and LESS).
    Repo directory structure: removed the compiled CSS from the root in favor of a large direct download link on the docs homepage. Compiled CSS is in /docs/assets/css/.
    Docs and repo: one makefile, just type make in the Terminal and get updated docs and CSS.

Scaffolding
Grid system

    Updated grid system, now only 12 columns instead of 16
    Responsive approach means your projects virtually work out of the box on smartphones, tablets, and more
    Removed unused (by default) grid columns support for 17-24 columns

Responsive (media queries)

    Media queries added for basic support across mobile and tablet devices
    Responsive CSS is compiled separately, as bootstrap-responsive.css

Base CSS
Typography

    h4 elements were dropped from 16px to 14px with a default line-height of 18px
    h5 elements were dropped from 14px to 12px
    h6 elements were dropped from 13px to 11px
    Right-aligned option for blockquotes if float: right;

Code

    New graphical style for &lt;code&gt;
    Google Code Prettify styles updated (based on GitHub's gists)

Tables

    Improved support for colspan and rowspan
    Styles now restricted to new base class, .table
    Table classes standardized with .table- required as a prefix
    Removed unused table color options (too much code for such little impact)
    Dropped support for TableSorter

Buttons

    New classes for colors and sizes, all prefixed with .btn-
    IE9: removed gradients and added rounded corners
    Updated active state to make styling clearer in button groups (new) and look better with custom transition
    New mixin, .buttonBackground, to set button gradients

Forms

    Default form style is now vertical (stacked) to use less CSS and add greater flexibility
    Form classes standardized with .form- required as a prefix
    New built-in form defaults for search, inline, and horizontal forms
    More flexible horizontal form markup with classes for all styling, including new optional class for the label
    Form states: colors updated and customizable via new LESS variables

Icons, by Glyphicons

    New Glyphicons Halflings icon set added in sprite form, in black and white
    Simple markup required for an icon in tons of contexts: &lt;i class="icon-cog"&gt;&lt;/&gt;
    Add another class, .icon-white, for white variation of the same icon

Components
Button groups and dropdowns

    Two brand new components in 2.0: button groups and button dropdowns
    Dependency: button dropdowns are built on button groups, and therefore require all their styles
    Button groups, .btn-group, can be grouped one level higher with a button toolbar, .btn-toolbar

Navigation

    Tabs and pills now require the use of a new base class, .nav, on their &lt;ul&gt;
    New nav list variation added that uses the same base class, .nav
    Vertical tabs and pills have been added—just add .nav-stacked to the &lt;ul&gt;
    Pills were restyled to be less rounded by default
    Pills now have dropdown menu support (they share the same markup and styles as tabs)

Navbar (formerly topbar)

    Base class changed from .topbar to .navbar
    Now supports static position (default behavior, not fixed) and fixed to the top of viewport via .navbar-fixed-top (previously only supported fixed)
    Added vertical dividers to top-level nav
    Improved support for inline forms in the navbar, which now require .navbar-form to properly scope styles to only the intended forms.
    Navbar search form now requires use of the .navbar-search class and its input the use of .search-query. To position the search form, you must use .pull-left or .pull-right.
    Added optional responsive markup for collapsing navbar contents for smaller resolutions and devices.

Dropdown menus

    Updated the .dropdown-menu to tighten up spacing
    Now requires you to add a &lt;span class="caret"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to show the dropdown arrow
    The navbar (fixed topbar) has brand new dropdowns. Gone are the dark versions and in their place are the standard white ones with an additional caret at their tops for clarity of position.

Labels

    Label colors updated to match form state colors
    Not only do they match graphically, but they are powered by the same new variables

Thumbnails

    Formerly .media-grid, now just .thumbnails, we've thoroughly extended this component for more uses while maintaining overall simplicity out of the box.
    Individual thumbnails now require .thumbnail class

Alerts

    New base class: .alert instead of .alert-message
    Class names standardized for other options, now all starting with .alert-
    Redesigned base alert styles to combine the deafult alerts and block-level alerts into one
    Block level alert class changed: .alert-block instead of .block-message

Progress bars

    New in 2.0
    Features multiple styles via classes, including striped and animated variations via CSS3

Miscellaneous components

    Added documentation for the well component and the close icon (used in modals and alerts)

Javascript plugins

We're rewritten just about everything for our plugins, so head on over to the Javascript page to learn more.
Popovers

    Child elements now properly namespaced: .title to .popover-title, .inner to .popover-inner, and .content to .popover-content.

New plugins

    Carousel
    Typeahead
